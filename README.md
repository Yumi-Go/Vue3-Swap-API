## Description
I developed Star Wars project which requests API call to swapi api, and then stores data in local storage, and shows data on the web browser. (SWAPI API: https://swapi.dev/)

1. Fetching data by requesting API calls to SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/), and then saving them to local storage.
2. Implementing a table that contains a list of people with their Name, Height, Mass, Created, Edited, and Planet Name.
3. Opening a popup that shows the planet's Name, Diameter, Climate, and Population when the user clicks on the Planet Name, 
4. Sorting people on the table by each column.
5. Filtering people by searching the personâ€™s name by default.
6. Filtering people by searching with multiple tags which represent each column.
7. Column Drag n Drop
8. Scrolling to the top of the page
9. Pagination: fetching the previous/next page from API
